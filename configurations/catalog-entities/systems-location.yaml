#  A system is a collection of resources and components.
#  The system may expose or consume one or several APIs.
#  It is viewed as abstraction level that provides potential consumers insights into exposed features without needing
#  a too detailed view into the details of all components. This also gives the owning team the possibility
#  to decide about published artifacts and APIs.
